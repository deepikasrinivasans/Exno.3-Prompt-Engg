# Experiment 3: Designing a Climate Change Awareness Campaign
## Aim
To design a comprehensive and engaging climate change awareness campaign that:
. Educates the public about local and global climate issues.
. Inspires individual and collective action.
. Encourages sustainable behaviors across communities.
This experiment uses a scenario-based approach and preceding question prompting to structure the campaign plan, ensuring it is robust, scalable, and adaptable.

## Introduction
Climate change is one of the most urgent global challenges, impacting health, economy, and ecosystems. While policies and technology play a role, public awareness and behavioral change are equally critical.

This experiment develops a climate change awareness campaign that resonates with multiple audiences by:

- Using scenario-based campaign planning.

- Applying prompt engineering (preceding question prompting).

- Delivering targeted yet unified messaging for impact.

The campaign aims not only to inform but to empower communities toward collective responsibility and sustainable living.
